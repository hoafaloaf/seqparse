v0.2.0 (2017/03/17)
-------------------

Changes (from v0.1.3)

* FrameChunk and FrameSequence instances now have similar behavior when used as
  iterators.
* Testing on Linux-based machines now accepts executable test files (as I'm
  spending half my time programming on a Windows box).
* Yes, we do need some stinkin' badges. README.md now indicates build status
  (travis-ci), coverage percentage (coveralls.io), and code health
  (landscape.io).

v0.1.3 (2017/03/16)
-------------------

Changes (from v0.1.1)

* Added coveralls support! Now you can look at code coverage for the
  project on coverage.io. And I get to add a pretty badge to the
  README.md.

v0.1.2 (2017/03/16)
-------------------

Changes (from v0.1.1)

* Frame sequences may now be directly added to any Seqparse instance via
  the add_file method.
* FrameChunk instances are now iterable and have proper containment
  tests for both (padded) string and integer frames.
* FileSequence and Singletons classes have been refactored to
  FileSequenceContainer and SingletonContainer, respectively, to more
  accurately reflect their functionality.


v0.1.1 (2017/03/15)
-------------------

Test/Bugfix Release

Changes (from v.0.1)

* seqls: It's accessed the same old way (ie, "seqls" from the command
  line), but it's no longer a dedicated script; it's been moved to
  seqparse.cli.seqls to ease installation.
* The test suite has been expanded to cover pretty much everything as it
  currently stands.
o Fixed a bug where the padding on single frames wasn't resolving
  properly.
o README.md updated with a laundry list of stuff I'd like to do before
  I'm moderately satisfied with my coding endeavours.

v0.1 (2017/03/14)
-----------------

Initial release with basic functionality.

* Primary usage is via the included "seqls" script.
* May be installed via setuptools-supplied setup.py.
* No real documentation (yet).
